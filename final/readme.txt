My Virtual StylistI want to create a web application that can be used by users who are packing for a trip, shopping online or just need outfit inspiration. The application creates (randomizes) different outfits for different occasions. Eventually I would like it so that users are able to upload their own clothing items so it can be personalized to them. Code PlanThe user has different buttons to click on: ‘work’, ‘everyday’, ‘date’ and ‘surprise me’. When the user clicks a button a new outfit generates under the category they have selected.  The types of functions I used are: draw, array and buttonPressedInput- Buttom- Click buttonOutput- Random array
